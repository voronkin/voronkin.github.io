Please refer to the type sheet in the tutorial to choose the wanted type\r\n     * * The parameter `size` (positive float, default 1) sets the polygon size\r\n     * * You can overwrite the `size` on each dimension bu using the parameters `sizeX`, `sizeY` or `sizeZ` (positive floats, default to `size` value)\r\n     * * You can build other polyhedron types than the 15 embbeded ones by setting the parameter `custom` (`polyhedronObject`, default null). If you set the parameter `custom`, this overwrittes the parameter `type`\r\n     * * A `polyhedronObject` is a formatted javascript object. You'll find a full file with pre-set polyhedra here : https://github.com/BabylonJS/Extensions/tree/master/Polyhedron\r\n     * * You can set the color and the UV of each side of the polyhedron with the parameters `faceColors` (Color4, default `(1, 1, 1, 1)`) and faceUV (Vector4, default `(0, 0, 1, 1)`)\r\n     * * To understand how to set `faceUV` or `faceColors`, please read this by considering the right number of faces of your polyhedron, instead of only 6 for the box : https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/createbox_per_face_textures_and_colors\r\n     * * The parameter `flat` (boolean, default true). If set to false, it gives the polyhedron a single global face, so less vertices and shared normals. In this case, `faceColors` and `faceUV` are ignored\r\n     * * You can also set the mesh side orientation with the values : BABYLON.Mesh.FRONTSIDE (default), BABYLON.Mesh.BACKSIDE or BABYLON.Mesh.DOUBLESIDE\r\n     * * If you create a double-sided mesh, you can choose what parts of the texture image to crop and stick respectively on the front and the back sides with the parameters `frontUVs` and `backUVs` (Vector4). Detail here : https://doc.babylonjs.com/babylon101/discover_basic_elements#side-orientation\r\n     * * The mesh can be set to updatable with the boolean parameter `updatable` (default false) if its
